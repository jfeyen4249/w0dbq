Great River Amateur Radio Club

Proposal: Iowa's historical railroad stations-- a two-month on the air special event sponsored by the Great River Amateur Radio Club

Date: to be determined

Goals to:
* Bring recognition to Iowa State's rich railroad history
* Provide certificates of recognition to the clubs or individuals activating five or more abandoned or former railroad stations
* Provide certificates to amateur radio operators who contact five or more different railroad stations. A SASE with a record of the contacts will be required and this will be verified with the information on the club special event website
* To get Iowa amateur radio operators on the air and have fun

Action items:
* the special event will need a place on the club's website for:
o  background information on the State of Iowa's railroad history 
o the goals
o the rules
o a place where the Iowa amateur radio operators can register the railroad stations from which they operated
o a place where the clubs or individuals operating from a former or abandon railroad station can list the contacts they have made. In other words, they would submit a list of the amateur radio operators they contacted
* obtain images from the Iowa State Historical Society that can be used for the club website and for the certificates
* list the event with QST
* publicize the event to amateur radio clubs across the State of Iowa with pertinent and corresponding information

Comments: Although it was a lot of work, we had a lot of fun sponsoring the 2020 IASPOTA event and it brought recognition to the Great River Amateur Radio Club. I have already spoken with Lee Garner, our Iowa Section Manager. We have her support. In addition, I have contacted the Iowa State Historical Society about images we can use. A month ago, I mentioned the possibility of this event on the ITEN and following the net, several net participants showed their interest and support for the event.
There are about 370 railroad depots in the state of Iowa. Some are abandoned and others are still in use. Furthermore, many have been moved to other sites and that will be part of the challenge. Some have been refurbished as museums or business establishments. As with the state park event there will have to be some protocols, but I think the railroad museums will very much support this. Permission may be necessary to use some abandon sites or to set up an amateur radio station in front of or in an established business; but clearly, we will have to stay away from active railroad stations. We will look at the list and pare it back.
