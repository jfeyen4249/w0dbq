The Great River Amateur Radio Club is happy to announce that this summer, 2022, it will sponsor an on-the-air event celebrating Iowa's rich railroad history. It will be called IRROTA, or in other words, Iowa Railroads on the Air. The event will run through the months of July and August 2022. This will be a great opportunity to remember Iowa's railroad history and the railroad depots across the state. 
Website: The Great River Amateur Radio Club will have a website where you can upload the name of the depot(s) you worked from and the contacts you made. It will also contain the rules pertaining to the IRROTA event. 

Iowa has approximately 375 former railroad depots. Most have been abandoned, others are active railroad depots, some, such as the one in Dubuque have become museums, some have become business buildings, and some have been drug to other sites to serve other purposes. You can operate from any of these train depots. However, if you work from one that has become a business you will of course need to have permission; and if you work from one that is an active train station you probably also need permission. Of course, you'll want to stay out of the way so there are no accidents or problems.
