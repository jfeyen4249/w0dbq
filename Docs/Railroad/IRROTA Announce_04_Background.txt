While not as soon as on the more populous East Coast railroad routes, railroad transportation in Iowa began by the late 1840s. Iowa had approximately 655 miles of track in operation by 1860, and another 2683 miles by 1870. The mileage grew to almost 9200 by the turn-of-the-century and peaked between 1911 and 1917 with more than 10,500 roadway miles of track.

Iowa's farms with the rich black soil were growing prodigious amounts of grain, corn, soybeans that needed to get to the markets. In addition, railroads were needed to send pigs and cattle to the Chicago slaughterhouses and Eastern markets. Coal and other minerals were mined and required transportation; and finally, manufacturing began for the agriculture market. John Deere and other manufacturers of agricultural tractors and implements needed transportation to reach the markets beyond the state of Iowa.

It should be further noted that Iowa held, and still holds today, an important geographical transportation position in the United States. Major railways cross it as a part of a national network for coast-to-coast rail traffic.
