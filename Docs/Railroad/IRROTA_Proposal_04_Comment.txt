Although it was a lot of work, we had a lot of fun sponsoring the 2020 IASPOTA event and it brought recognition to the Great River Amateur Radio Club. I have already spoken with Lee Garner, our Iowa Section Manager. We have her support. In addition, I have contacted the Iowa State Historical Society about images we can use. A month ago, I mentioned the possibility of this event on the ITEN and following the net, several net participants showed their interest and support for the event.

There are about 370 railroad depots in the state of Iowa. Some are abandoned and others are still in use. Furthermore, many have been moved to other sites and that will be part of the challenge. Some have been refurbished as museums or business establishments. As with the state park event there will have to be some protocols, but I think the railroad museums will very much support this. Permission may be necessary to use some abandon sites or to set up an amateur radio station in front of or in an established business; but clearly, we will have to stay away from active railroad stations. We will look at the list and pare it back.
